# Contributing to AI-Assisted Coding Education

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to provide clear, educational examples of coding practices and algorithm analysis.

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add Examples in Other Languages
- Implement existing examples in languages like:
  - Rust
  - Java
  - C++
  - TypeScript
  - Ruby
  - Swift

### 2. Add New Algorithm Comparisons
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort vs quicksort vs timsort)
- Search algorithms (linear vs binary vs hash-based)
- Data structure operations (list vs set vs dict)
- String manipulation examples

### 3. Improve Documentation
- Add more detailed explanations
- Create additional visualizations
- Improve mermaid diagrams
- Add performance benchmarks

### 4. Fix Bugs or Issues
- Review open issues
- Submit bug fixes
- Improve code quality

## 📝 Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8
- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features, semicolons
- **Go**: Follow Go conventions (gofmt)
- Add comments explaining the algorithm approach
- Include docstrings/comments for functions

### Example Structure
Each example should include:
1. Clear problem statement
2. Multiple solution approaches (vibe/human/expert)
3. Performance comparison
4. Edge case handling
5. Comments explaining key concepts

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add mermaid diagrams where helpful
- Provide "Key Takeaways" sections

### File Organization
```
examples/
  XX-example-name/
    ├── README.md          # Explanation and analysis
    ├── example.py         # Python implementation
    ├── example.js         # JavaScript implementation
    └── example.go         # Go implementation
```

## 🚀 Submission Process
