Great question — this is **exactly** the right next layer for the pilot.



Your new graph is ready:

## **How to Read This Graph (Key Insight)**





This visualization answers your question directly:



> **Is more manual time required for better code quality?**

> **No — but neither is “more prompting.”**





### **What the data shows conceptually**



| **Approach**     | **Outcome**                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Manual-Heavy** | Decent quality, but slower and cognitively expensive         |
| **Prompt-Heavy** | Fast output, but quality drops (hallucinations, weak architecture) |
| **Balanced**     | **Highest code quality** with optimal time investment        |

🔑 **Code quality peaks when humans stay in the loop**, guiding structure, reviewing decisions, and applying judgment.



------





## **Teaching / Pilot Talking Points (Very Important)**







### **1️⃣ Time ≠ Quality**





> “Spending more time manually does not guarantee better code.”



Quality comes from:



- Architectural decisions

- Edge-case reasoning

- Validation and review

  —not keystrokes.





------





### **2️⃣ Prompting Is Not Free**





> “Prompting is cognitive labor.”



Poor prompts:



- Shift thinking to the model
- Reduce ownership
- Increase debugging time later





------





### **3️⃣ The Sweet Spot: Human-AI Collaboration**





The **Balanced** approach wins because:



- Humans define *intent, constraints, and quality bar*
- AI accelerates *execution, refactoring, tests*
- Humans validate outcomes





This aligns perfectly with:



- Senior engineer behavior
- Governance expectations
- Responsible AI usage





------





## **How This Fits Your Pilot Narrative**





You now have a **three-slide logical progression**:



1. **Explain vs Implement Time**

   → When AI is worth using

2. **Junior vs Senior Gap**

   → Who benefits and how

3. **Time vs Quality Curve**

   → *How to use AI well*





Together they reinforce:



> **AI does not replace thinking — it amplifies disciplined thinking.**



This analysis is *pilot-grade and leadership-ready*.
