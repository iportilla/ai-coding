# Product Overview

## AI-Assisted Coding Education

This repository is an educational resource demonstrating the differences between quick prototyping ("vibe coding"), thoughtful optimization ("human coding"), and expert-level algorithmic solutions.

### Purpose
- Teach algorithm analysis and Big O notation through practical examples
- Illustrate trade-offs between rapid prototyping and production-ready code
- Demonstrate the importance of edge case handling and defensive programming
- Show security considerations in code implementation

### Target Audience
- Computer science students learning algorithm analysis
- Developers transitioning from prototyping to production code
- Teams discussing code quality and performance trade-offs
- Anyone wanting to understand Big O notation in practical terms

### Key Educational Concepts
- **Vibe Coding**: Quick prototypes, exploration, simple problems
- **Human Coding**: Production code, edge cases, maintainability
- **Expert Coding**: Performance-critical, large datasets, well-solved problems

### Success Metrics
Educational impact is measured by:
- Clear demonstration of algorithmic complexity differences
- Practical performance comparisons (up to 100x speed improvements)
- Real-world applicability of examples
- Accessibility to different skill levels
